    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  it will make sure these meshes are handled without 
  any errors. I may try to include the level-of-detail 
  data it introduces into compiled meshes later on.
______________________________________________________

[v2.50] (April 13th, 2019)

• Rewrote the Rthro scaling logic so that avatars
  are scaled 100% accurately across the board.
• Improved the emulation of avatar animations.
  It still isn't 100% perfect, but it should be A LOT
  more accurate than it was previously.
• Added the avatar pose animation to the set of
  animations exported for R15 avatars.
• (Hopefully) put the final nail in the coffin to any
  localization related formatting issues.
• Fixed a bug where the compiler would fail if the
  inputted user was wearing an invalid asset.
• Fixed a bug where untextured parts would not be
  colored if they were using Color3uint8 instead of 
  BrickColor to store their color.
• Fixed a bug where limbs could become invisible if
  one of their parts was fully transparent.
• Fixed a bug where untrimmed asset names would
  cause problems with material file linkage.
______________________________________________________

[v2.41] (March 28th, 2019)

• Fixed some regressions pertaining to the settings
  initialization phase.
______________________________________________________

[v2.40] (March 28th, 2019)

• Added mostly-complete support for animation
  packs! Some of the animation data still isn't quite 
  mapped correctly, and it will need further work
  before it is 100% accurate to how it looks on
  Roblox.
• Did a large-scale clean-up pass to the project's
  code-base so that its significantly cleaner and
  much easier to read. Some things have been 
  rewritten, while others have just been adjusted 
  and branched up into smaller chunks.
• Reduced the output's tendency to jerk around
  violently when text was being written off-screen.
• Made a few minor adjustments to the splash screen 
  so that it doesn't freeze up while the main
  window is initializing.
______________________________________________________

[v2.30] (October 25th, 2018)

• Integrated support for Roblox's new avatar scaling
  system, and full support for Rthro characters.
• Improved the collision geometry for ragdolls.
• Avatars will now properly align to the ground when
  being shown in the model viewer.
• New logo and splash screen to be more up to speed
  with Roblox's new logo.
• Fixed a regression introduced in  the preliminary 
  Rthro support patch. Face textures shouldn't 
  throw errors in some cases anymore..
• Fixed some coloring problems pertaining to meshes
  that have vertex color data.
• Cleaned up more of the code backend for the sake
  of readability.
______________________________________________________

[v2.22] (October 23rd, 2018)

• Fixed a bug where package limbs using the 
  artist-intent mode would not be detected properly
  during compilation
• Fixed a bug where 64-bit integers were not being
  handled correctly in the binary file format
• Added partial support for Rthro avatars. I still 
  need to integrate scaling support for avatar 
  limbs, so some results might still look weird.
  I'm investigating the specs for these characters
  and hopefully should have some results soon.
• Cleaned up some of the backend code.
______________________________________________________

[v2.21] (September 3rd, 2018)

• Fixed an issue where the binary file format was not
  correctly reading non-orthogonal CFrame rotations.
  This should fix geometry corruption cases for newer
  Roblox catalog items.
______________________________________________________

[v2.20] (September 3rd, 2018)

• Humanoid texture compositing is now done within
  the program instead of snatching from Roblox's
  3D avatar thumbnails. This change will open the
  door to more customization for avatar importing
  later down the road.
• Fixed a bug where attempting to compile some
  users would result in an HTTP 400 error.
______________________________________________________

[v2.14] (August 23rd, 2018)

• Fixed a bug that was preventing users from viewing
  their compiled models in Garry's Mod.
• Fixed a bug that was making Accessories and Gear
  fail to compile.
• Worked around an issue that was preventing
  terminated Roblox users from being compiled.
______________________________________________________

[v2.13] (August 21st, 2018)

• Fixed a bug where localization was interfering with
  the generated model data. 
• Refactored the runtime reflection code to make
  more use of templates, so the code for working with
  instances requires less downcasting behind the
  scenes.
• Improved the accuracy of the R15 floor level.
______________________________________________________

[v2.12] (August 14th, 2018)

• Patching up a few more small issues with head
  meshes.
• Fixed a regression with R6 avatars.
______________________________________________________

[v2.11] (August 14th, 2018)

• Fixed a regression involving SpecialMesh 
  VertexColors.
• Fixed a regression where the main screen would say
  "User does not exist" upon initially launching the
  program.
• Updated the default Head mesh to use significantly
  better normal mapping.
• Reduced the verbosity of asset retrieval in the
  compiler log.
• Attempted to improve detection of Steam.
______________________________________________________

[v2.10] (August 14th, 2018)

• Fixed a bug where the program would sometimes
  claim a user doesn't exist, even though it does.
• Updated the program backend to use 64-bit
  UserIds and AssetIds.
• Implemented support for Roblox's binary file
  format, as it is now required going forward with
  R15 avatars. Implementing this was a massive
  undertaking, hence why it took awhile for me to
  properly fix this program.
• Ported over the lookup table functionality of avatar
  heads, so they should now compile consistently no
  matter what.
______________________________________________________

[v2.08] (February 15th, 2018)
• Fixed a bug where the R15 texture assembler 
  wasn't using the right texture.
• Fixed a bug where invisible limbs would be
  generated when using R15 package limbs, like the 
  peg leg.
• Replaced spellings of "ROBLOX" with "Roblox".
______________________________________________________

[v2.07] (June 4th, 2017)

• Refactored a lot of the model compiler code,
  so models should compile MUCH faster now.
• Rewrote the asset fetcher so that it properly caches
  assets that have been loaded at least once from the
  website. 
• Fixed some parser issues that could occur due to
  some weird culture localization features.
• If a user is wearing the "Blockhead" head, it should
  be generated correctly now.
______________________________________________________

[v2.06] (May 31st, 2017)

• Fixed a compiler crash that was caused by the 
  introduction of vertex color metadata to the binary
  mesh file format.
• Reformatted some of the mesh parser code to make
  it faster.
______________________________________________________

[v2.05] (January 31st, 2017)

• Fixed a compiler crash that was caused by the
  removal of an important web API that I used.
• Updated to use the new avatar web APIs.

______________________________________________________

[v2.04] (January 21st, 2017)

• Rbx2Source will now fallback to finding a running
  instance of Steam, if it cannot find the directory.
______________________________________________________

[v2.03] (January 1st, 2017)

• Fixed a small bug that was causing the compiler to 
  fail with users who glitched a space after their 
  name.
______________________________________________________

[v2.02] (January 1st, 2017)

• Added a "Change Log" tab!
• Improved the appearance of objects with
  transparency.
• Added some safeguards while I investigate whatever
  is causing the "generic error in GDI+" stuff to 
  popup for some people.
______________________________________________________

[v2.01] (December 30th, 2016)

  library, Rbx2Source will now properly detect 
  Source engine games in there.

• Completely rewrote Rbx2Source from the ground up.
• Support for both R6 and R15 characters
• Geometry is assembled directly from the source mesh 
  files, instead of doing some clever hacks with 3D 
  thumbnail data.
• Source Engine games are automatically listed, you no 
  longer have to set it up manually
• Brand new interface, with a much better presentation 
  and more responsive controls.
• Written entirely in C#, no more Lua!
• R6 Characters are assembled much more accurately 
  than they were in v1
* Animations are emulated directly from Roblox into 
  Source.
• The foundation I've laid for this version is much 
  stronger than it was before, and will allow me 
  to add more features with relative ease.
• The launcher is no longer a seperate application
______________________________________________________

[v1.60] (June 18th, 2015)
